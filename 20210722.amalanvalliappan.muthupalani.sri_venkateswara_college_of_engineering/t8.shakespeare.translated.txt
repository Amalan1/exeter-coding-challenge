look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at moins one byte more or less.


Information sur Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce sur two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty heures is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entrered, preuveread, edited, copydroite
cherchered and analyzed, the copydroite lettres Ã©crit, etc.  This
projeted audience is one cent million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per mois:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand Titres each to one cent million readers,
lequel is 10% of the expected nombre of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.
